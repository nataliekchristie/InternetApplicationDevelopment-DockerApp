# Docker Swarm App: Internet Application Development Final Project

A web application that allows users to post listings of products that they wish to sell, buy, etc. The goal of this project was to apply our knowledge gained from this semester including JavaScript functions, Docker, MongoDB, Kafka, and WebSocket. The project included multiple group members and was led by myself.
